This project is a basic implementation of an IDE for Java language that can edit already created file or projects.

It also have some funny images and noises.
With this IDE, auto-completion as shortcuts like ctrl+c, ctrl+s, ctrl+v are available.

To test our IDE, you just need to run the MyIdeApp.java file located at src/main/java/fr/epita/assistants/frontend/ folder.
